Known Issues:

1) App might not save photos if user has changed drive letter and did not configure the app again to the changed drive letter or save location
2) Converted image files will be compressed to 96 dpi. Not an issue but still need to code it out
3) Some image previews might stretch or not look good. Aspect ratio problem
4) file dialog will only show path instead of full path ie. no "/" at last

Features to be included in the future:
1) Height and Width (Resolution) adjustment
2) Quality or Dpi adjustment
3) User can add their desired image formats in the format selector dropdown pane
