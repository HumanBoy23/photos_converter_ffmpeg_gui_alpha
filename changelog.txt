Fix: File dialog will only show path instead of full path ie. no "/" at last (better fix to be implemented)

App might not save photos if user has changed drive letter and did not configure the app again to the changed drive letter or save location

Optimization:
Changed code for storing and getting user selected save location path for saving converted files. Now relies on memory rather than a config/save file
for reading the location/path to save converted image, further reducing code.

Fix: issue where user selects non-image type files preventing exceptions and possible crashes and notifies user to select an image file

Optimization:
Removed nesting for determining selected image format that user selects for saving the image into a format. Instead use data from variable to determine selected format

Rename "convert" button to "save" button
