Change log 15:05 28/03/2023
Fixed: File dialog will only show path instead of full path ie. no "/" at last (better fix to be implemented)
Fixed: App might not save photos if user has changed drive letter and did not configure the app again to the changed drive letter or save location

Optimization:
Changed code for storing and getting user selected save location path for saving converted files. Now relies on memory rather than a config/save file
for reading the location/path to save converted image, further reducing code.
